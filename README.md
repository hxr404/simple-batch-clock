# simple-batch-clock
This is a simple Clock coded only using Batch-Files. At the moment it's in German, as I don't have time to translate it yet.
The File "Watch.bat" is the Clock, and the File "Watch - Settings.bat" is to change the look of the clock. It uses the local system time.
I used this for my WindowsPE (it doesn't have a clock and no full .exe support)
